# Query Counting Simulation Oracle

Defines a simple `counting_oracle` simulation oracle that just counts the number of queries made.
The internal state of the oracle is exactly a `n : ℕ` giving the amount of queries at that point.
This value is always finite as the `oracle_comp` monad doesn't have unbounded recursion.
